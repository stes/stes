### Hi, I'm Steffen 👋

My goal is to build machine learning tools and statistical methods for decompiling intelligent behavior. In my [research group](http://dynamical-inference.ai/) at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/), we develop machine learning algorithms for representation learning and inference of nonlinear system dynamics, study how large and multi-modal biological datasets can be compressed into foundation models, and study their mechanistic interpretability.

If you are looking for opportunities for a position as a PhD student, postdoc, research engineer, research assistant, or an internship, Bachelor or Master’s thesis, please [have a look at our current openings](https://dynamical-inference.ai/join/) and ping me if you’re interested in working with us.

For science outreach, I co-founded [KI macht Schule](https://ki-macht-schule.de/), a non-profit organization teaching ML basics to high-school students.
We provide teachers with modern teaching materials, AI tools and infrastructure in our [open teaching hub](https://ki-macht-schule.de/plattform), and offer courses on AI for students and teachers in Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

I am also co-founder and CTO of [Kinematik AI](https://www.kinematik.ai/), a company offering customized machine intelligence solutions in the biopharma and animal healthcare sector.

Here are some pointers to my work:
