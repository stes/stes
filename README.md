### Hi, I'm Steffen 👋

I'm an incoming PI at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/) and will head the [Dynamical Inference Lab](http://dynamical-inference.ai/) from February 2024. If you are looking for opportunities for a position as PhD student, postdoc, research engineer, research assistant, or an internship, Bachelor or Master’s thesis, [have a look at my past work and student projects](https://dynamical-inference.ai/team/) and ping me if you’re interested in working with me.

Interested in AI communication? I am also co-founder of [KI macht Schule](https://ki-macht-schule.de/), a non-profit organization teaching ML basics to high-school students. We provide teachers with [modern teaching software](https://ki-macht-schule.de/plattform) and are the first German company to offer fully German-hosted LLMs for education purposes.

I am also co-founder and CTO of [Kinematik AI](https://www.kinematik.ai/), a company offering customized machine vision and multi-modal learning systems.
